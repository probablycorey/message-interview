# What should you do?

This repo is a "guess the animal" game written in React and TypeScript. It uses the OpenAI API to generate the responses to your guesses. It looks like this:

Right now the game works, but it feels very robotic and boring. Your job is to make it more fun and playful! For example, you could make the design more interesting, add animations, sound effects, whatever you think would make this more fun.

You can change any file, but most of the work will be in `src/App.tsx` and `src/index.css`. You can also add new files if you want.

Also if you're more comfortable using tailwind, or styled-components, or something else, feel free to change the styling system.

When you're done, please send me a link to your repo or zip it up into a file end send it over so I can check it out!
